## S3 Access block should restrict public bucket to limit access

### Explanation


S3 buckets should restrict public policies for the bucket. By enabling, the restrict_public_buckets, only the bucket owner and AWS Services can access if it has a public policy.



### Insecure Example

The following example will fail the AWS075 check.

{% highlight terraform %}

resource "aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block" "bad_example" {
	bucket = aws_s3_bucket.example.id
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block" "bad_example" {
	bucket = aws_s3_bucket.example.id
  
	restrict_public_buckets = false
}

{% endhighlight %}



### Secure Example

The following example will pass the AWS075 check.

{% highlight terraform %}

resource "aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block" "good_example" {
	bucket = aws_s3_bucket.example.id
  
	restrict_public_buckets = true
}

{% endhighlight %}
