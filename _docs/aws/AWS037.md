***IAM Password policy should prevent password reuse.***

## Explanation


IAM account password policies should prevent the reuse of passwords. 

The account password policy should be set to prevent using any of the last five used passwords.


## Insecure Example

The following example will fail the AWS037 check.

{% highlight hcl %}

resource "aws_iam_account_password_policy" "strict" {
	...
	password_reuse_prevention = 1
	...
}

{% endhighlight %}

## Secure Example

The following example will pass the AWS037 check.

{% highlight hcl %}

resource "aws_iam_account_password_policy" "strict" {
	...
	password_reuse_prevention = 5
	...
}

{% endhighlight %}
