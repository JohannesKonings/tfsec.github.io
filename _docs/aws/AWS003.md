***AWS Classic resource usage.***

## Explanation


AWS Classic resources run in a shared environment with infrastructure owned by other AWS customers. You should run
resources in a VPC instead.



## Insecure Example

The following example will fail the AWS003 check.

{% highlight terraform %}

resource "aws_db_security_group" "my-group" {
  # ...
}

{% endhighlight %}
