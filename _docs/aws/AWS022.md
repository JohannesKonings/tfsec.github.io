***A MSK cluster allows unencrypted data in transit.***

### Explanation


Encryption should be forced for Kafka clusters, including for communication between nodes. This ensure sensitive data is kept private.



### Insecure Example

The following example will fail the AWS022 check.

{% highlight terraform %}

resource "aws_msk_cluster" "msk-cluster" {
	encryption_info {
		encryption_in_transit {
			client_broker = "TLS_PLAINTEXT"
			in_cluster = true
		}
	}
}

{% endhighlight %}



### Secure Example

The following example will pass the AWS022 check.

{% highlight terraform %}

resource "aws_msk_cluster" "msk-cluster" {
	encryption_info {
		encryption_in_transit {
			client_broker = "TLS"
			in_cluster = true
		}
	}
}

{% endhighlight %}
